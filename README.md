# Dataset: Source Code, Raw Data, Processed Data, Processing Scripts, and Results of the APPLE-POPDYN Model

## 1. Description

This dataset contains the model source code and original output from 500 model runs of the APPLE-POPDYN model, a dynamic simulation model designed to explore leaf miner herbivory in a system of mutual influences with plant physiological processes, plant growth, and leaf miner phenology.

In addition to the raw model outputs, the dataset includes processed data used to generate the figures presented in the results section of the associated publication. The dataset is intended to promote transparency and reproducibility of the simulation and analysis process.

## 2. Folder Structure

- `model src/`: Netlogo source code of the APPLE-POPDYN model
- `data/raw/`: Original model output from 500 simulation runs across different model scenarios. The raw data files are archived on Zenodo due to their size. Below is a description of each file in the data/raw/ directory.
- `data/processed/`: Simulated and observed data used to generate the figures in the result section.
- `scripts/`: R scripts used to process raw data and generate the analytical figures.
- `results/`: Outcome of model calibration and validation, and results from scenario analyses focused on leaf miner behavior.

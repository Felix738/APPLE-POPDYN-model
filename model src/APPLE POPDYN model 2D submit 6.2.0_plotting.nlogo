## WHAT IS IT?

The FRUIT model quantifies leaf mining damage inflicted by the spotted tentiform leafminer (_Phyllonorycter blancardella_) on its main host, the apple tree (_Malus domestica_) in an interactive system of leaf mining damage, plant physiology, and host selection. It can be used to investigate feedback effects of leaf mining damage on underlying insect phenolgy.

## HOW IT WORKS

The general modelling approach consists of two parts: firstly modelling plant physiology, and plant growth, and secondly modelling leaf miner phenology, and leaf mining damage. It is set up for the temperate climate zone, and includes environmental variation of incoming solar radiation, temperature and soil moisture. The model simulates growth processes of one individual apple tree over a period of 30 years in half-weekly timesteps with main outputs leaf number and fruit number. Each year individual leaves are infested by leaf mining insects which reduce the leaves photosynthetic capacity and thus the leaves capacity to produce fruits. On the other hand leaf mining insects have certain preferences towards their host leaves, including nutritional value and leaf vitality. This accounts for an interactive system in between leaf mining damage and leaf miner selection of individual leaves.   

## HOW TO USE IT

The model can be run stepwise or continuously. Sliders and Input boxes allow for the  regulation of most important model parameters. To investigate leaf mining damage certain procedures need to be changed manually. 

The switch "Damage?" controls if the apple tree is under infestation (leaf mining damage) or not (control treatment). In addition leaf miner host selection can be either switched on or off with the slider "No-learning?" which results in "picky" leaf miners or leaf miners not being "picky at all" in regard to leaf attributes. In addition the "picky" leaf miners also have a built-in learning ability which constantly redefines host selection thresholds. Those thresholds are dependent on the attributes of already visited leaves. If "No-learning?" is switched off leaf miners make oviposition choices depending on their implemented learning behavior. If "No-learning?" is switched on leaf miners make oviposition decisions depending on fixed plant vigor and nutritional value thresholds which can be determined by sliders.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

**Host selection thresholds** are crucial parameters to this model. They determine how leaf mining insects select suitable leaves for oviposition. In the current model state those thresholds can be either set manually or they are determined by the learning behavior of the insects. 

In addition the model is very sensitive towards changes in min_PARI and max_PARI and will result in a manyfold inrease or decrease in primary production. 

Most important variables in relation to environment (1.), plant physiology (2.), and insect phenology (3.) can be observed in the respective plots.

## THINGS TO TRY

Play around with the host searching preferences of leaf miners and observe how leaf miner populations fluctuate accordingly. 

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

(suggested things to add or change in the Code tab to make the model more complicated, detailed, accurate, etc.)
Next to host selection also a very simplistic type of learning behavior is implemented in this model. Leaf miners are able to shift their host selection depending on leaf attributes of previously visited leaves. This learning behavior can be further expanded. 

## NETLOGO FEATURES

(interesting or unusual features of NetLogo that the model uses, particularly in the Code tab; or where workarounds were needed for missing features)
Note the use of the profiler extension to identify most computationally intense procedures. In addition leaves are determined as superindividuals where one superindividual leaf accounts for 20 individual leaves. Also note the application of the "virtual-ecologist" procedure where field sampling is simulated in the model.
